Homework from the course Computer Enhance by Casey Muratori.


### Disclaimer

This course is being followed in a MacOS Big Sur (v. 11.6.5) from 2018, even if the Rust compiler should take care that the code works in any platform, it might not be the case and I apologize in advance if this is your case :)
